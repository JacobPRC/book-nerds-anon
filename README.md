# Book Nerds Anon

MERN stack graphql app where users can create books

## About

Using the MERN stack, this app allows users to anonymously create books. Then anyone can create content for the book, like and comment on it. Think madlibs, but as a web app

### Motivation

This app was really similar to another app I built, Lyriql Gangsta. I wanted to take the knowledge I gained from building the previous app and expand and reinforce them. I ran into problems and realized that I didn't truly understand how data was modeled. With this app, I gained a much better understandig of data modeling, nesting and relationships, as well as solidifying my knowledge of Mongoose.  

## Built With:

### Front End

React <br />
Apollo-Client <br />

### Back End

Node.js <br />
Express <br />
Mongoose <br />
Express-GraphQL
